                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-ivory">1. Low Cost of Living</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-300">Mississippi boasts one of the lowest cost of living indices in the U.S., around 86 compared to the national average of 100. Median home prices in cities like Jackson and Gulfport hover around $150,000, far below the national median of $350,000. Monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment ranges from $800 to $1,200. Groceries, utilities, and healthcare are also affordable, making Mississippi ideal for those seeking financial ease. However, rural areas may have fewer amenities, so choose your location wisely.</p>

            <!-- Essential 2 -->
            <div class="card bg-burgundy rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6" style="--card-index: 2;">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-ivory">2. Subtropical Climate</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-300">Expect hot, humid summers with temperatures often above 90°F and mild winters averaging 40-50°F. Rainfall is common, especially in spring, and the Gulf Coast faces hurricane risks from June to November. Equip your home with air conditioning and storm supplies, particularly in coastal areas like Biloxi. If relocating from a cooler region, invest in breathable clothing and familiarize yourself with local weather patterns for comfort.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Essential 3 -->
            <div class="card bg-burgundy rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6" style="--card-index: 3;">

                <p class="text-gray-300">Mississippi’s economy is growing in sectors like manufacturing, healthcare, and tourism. Companies like Nissan in Canton and St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson offer opportunities. The unemployment rate is around 5%, slightly above the national average, with median incomes near $45,000.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-ivory">5. Car-Dependent State</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-300">Public transportation is limited, making a car essential for most residents, especially outside cities like Jackson or Gulfport. Gas prices average $3 per gallon, but humidity and occasional flooding demand regular vehicle upkeep. For a smooth move, rely on <a href="https://www.amerifreight.net/auto-shipping/" class="text-green hover:text-ivory shine-link">AmeriFreight’s auto shipping</a> to transport your vehicle safely, ensuring you’re ready to navigate Mississippi’s roads.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-300">Mississippi’s public schools vary in quality, with top districts like Madison and Rankin County standing out. Private and charter schools offer alternatives in urban areas. The state is home to respected institutions like Mississippi State University and the University of Southern Mississippi.

                <p class="text-gray-300">Mississippi’s cuisine is a highlight, with dishes like fried chicken, shrimp and grits, and sweet potato pie defining its culinary scene. Local restaurants in Meridian and Natchez emphasize fresh, local ingredients. The state’s relaxed lifestyle prioritizes community and family, with a slower pace than urban centers. Dive into local food festivals and farmers’ markets to connect with Mississippi’s vibrant food culture.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-ivory">9. Community and Safety</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-300">Mississippi’s communities, from small towns like Tupelo to cities like Biloxi, are tight-knit and welcoming. Crime rates vary, with Jackson reporting higher rates (4,000 per 100,000 residents) compared to safer areas like Madison. Join local organizations or attend community events to build connections. Consider home security systems in urban areas to enhance safety and settle in comfortably.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-ivory">10. Moving Logistics</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-300">Plan your move carefully, as urban rental markets like Gulfport can be competitive. Utilities are affordable, but rural areas may have less reliable internet.
